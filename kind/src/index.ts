 * This block's init-params contract — the shape a block of this kind receives

 * Deliberately empty: this block takes no author-supplied init params today.
 * Everything it needs is chosen in the UI after creation — the upstream PCA
 * embeddings come from a result-pool ref the user picks, and the resolution is
 * a numeric field on the settings panel. Neither is meaningful to seed from a
 * template file while the model is still on the V1 API, which has no `init()`
 * to receive params.
 *
 * `resolution` is the natural first param to expose once this block moves to
 * BlockModelV3. Adding an optional field to this contract later is backwards
 * compatible, so starting empty costs nothing.
