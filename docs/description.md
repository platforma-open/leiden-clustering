This block performs Leiden clustering on single-cell RNA-seq data using PCA embeddings as input. The input comes from upstream blocks such as Dimensionality Reduction or Batch Correction. The output are identified cell clusters that can be visualized or used in downstream blocks (e.g., Cell Browser or Cluster Markers).
